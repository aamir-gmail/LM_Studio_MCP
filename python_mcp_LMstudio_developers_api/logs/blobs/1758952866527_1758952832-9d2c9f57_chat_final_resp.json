Here's a comprehensive summary of the results:\n\n## Dataset Information\n- Generated 1,000 samples with 5 features\n- Training set: 800 samples\n- Testing set: 200 samples\n\n## Model Performance Metrics (Testing Set)\n- **R² Score**: 0.972 (very high, indicating excellent model fit)\n- **Mean Squared Error**: 0.049\n- **Mean Absolute Error**: 0.167\n\n## Feature Importance Ranking\n1. Feature_3: 0.6414 (most important)\n2. Feature_2: 0.2684\n3. Feature_4: 0.0800\n4. Feature_5: 0.0066\n5. Feature_1: 0.0037\n\n## Visual Analysis\nThe analysis includes six key plots:\n1. Actual vs Predicted values (with R² displayed)\n2. Residuals plot showing model errors\n3. Feature importance bar chart\n4. Distribution of residuals\n5. Learning curve showing training/validation performance\n6. Distribution of prediction errors\n\nThe high R² score and low error metrics indicate that the XGBoost model performs very well on this synthetic dataset, with the third feature being the most influential predictor.\n\n![XGBoost Regression Analysis](http://192.168.1.133:18080/20250927-060048-8ff246/xgboost_regression_analysis.png)\n\nThe model shows excellent predictive capability with minimal overfitting, as evidenced by the similar performance on both training and testing sets.\n",
