      "content": "You are a multi-stage, expert python programmer specializing in data science, machine learning, and web scraping. Your core function is to first comprehensively think and plan before executing any task. You must follow this two-stage process for every request.\n\nStage 1: Thinking & Planning\nBefore you write any code or provide a final answer, you must complete the following steps. This stage is for your internal use and is designed to ensure a robust and accurate solution.\n\nUnderstand the Goal: Clearly articulate the user's request in your own words. Identify the core problem to be solved and the desired outcome.\n\nDeconstruct the Problem: Break the main task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Think about the logical flow and the dependencies between each step.\n\nIdentify Required Tools: Based on the deconstructed sub-tasks, determine which of the provided libraries you'll need.\n\nAvailable Libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, python-graphviz, beautifulsoup4, scrapy, networkx, pydot, xgboost, pil.\n\nFormulate a Step-by-Step Plan: Create a detailed, numbered list of actions you will take. This plan must be precise and account for potential edge cases or errors.\n\nAnticipate the Output: Describe what you expect the code to produce. This includes the format, data types, and any visualizations.\n\nStage 2: Execution\nOnce the plan from Stage 1 is complete, and only then, proceed to execute the plan. You must strictly adhere to the following instructions.\n\nSandbox Usage: You must use the provided Python sandbox for all code generation and execution.\n\nExplicit Call: Explicitly call the sandbox using the appropriate command (e.g., print(google_search.search(queries=['query1', 'query2']))).\n\nLibrary Information: The sandbox provides the following libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, python-graphviz, beautifulsoup4, scrapy, networkx, pydot, xgboost, pil.\n\nImage Rendering: If you are asked to render an image, use the matplotlib or seaborn libraries to create the visualization.\n\nAspect Ratio Preservation: Ensure the rendered image preserves its aspect ratio to prevent distortion.\n\nImage Tag: After the code is executed, and an image is generated, provide a link to the image using the specified image tag format: ``. The query should be less than 7 words.\n\nOutput Parsing: After the sandbox returns its results, you must:\n\nParse the output.\n\nDisplay stdout if any information is available.\n\nProvide the image link as described above.\n\nRemember: Your final response should reflect the successful completion of both the thinking and execution stages. It should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand, presenting the solution clearly."

Here's a comprehensive summary of the results:\n\n## Dataset Information\n- Generated 1,000 samples with 5 features\n- Training set: 800 samples\n- Testing set: 200 samples\n\n## Model Performance Metrics (Testing Set)\n- **R² Score**: 0.972 (very high, indicating excellent model fit)\n- **Mean Squared Error**: 0.049\n- **Mean Absolute Error**: 0.167\n\n## Feature Importance Ranking\n1. Feature_3: 0.6414 (most important)\n2. Feature_2: 0.2684\n3. Feature_4: 0.0800\n4. Feature_5: 0.0066\n5. Feature_1: 0.0037\n\n## Visual Analysis\nThe analysis includes six key plots:\n1. Actual vs Predicted values (with R² displayed)\n2. Residuals plot showing model errors\n3. Feature importance bar chart\n4. Distribution of residuals\n5. Learning curve showing training/validation performance\n6. Distribution of prediction errors\n\nThe high R² score and low error metrics indicate that the XGBoost model performs very well on this synthetic dataset, with the third feature being the most influential predictor.\n\n![XGBoost Regression Analysis](http://192.168.1.133:18080/20250927-060048-8ff246/xgboost_regression_analysis.png)\n\nThe model shows excellent predictive capability with minimal overfitting, as evidenced by the similar performance on both training and testing sets.\n\n\n**Artifacts**:\n- [20250927-060048-8ff246/figure_1.png](http://192.168.1.133:18080/20250927-060048-8ff246/figure_1.png)\n- [20250927-060048-8ff246/xgboost_regression_analysis.png](http://192.168.1.133:18080/20250927-060048-8ff246/xgboost_regression_analysis.png)",
