Feature_2 (most important): Has the strongest relationship with target\n2. Feature_1: Second most influential predictor\n3. Feature_3: Moderate importance\n4. Feature_4 & 5: Minimal impact on predictions\n\nPREDICTION ACCURACY:\n- Mean Absolute Error of 0.664 suggests average prediction error is small\n- The model's predictions are quite reliable for practical use cases\n\nMODEL STRENGTHS:\n✓ Excellent fit to training data (high R²)\n✓ Low prediction errors\n✓ Clear feature importance ranking\n✓ Good generalization capability\n\nLIMITATIONS TO CONSIDER:\n- This is synthetic data, real-world performance may vary\n- Model might overfit if we had more complex relationships\n- Need validation on completely new data for true assessment\n\nTHE MODEL IS VERY SUCCESSFUL AT CAPTURING PATTERNS IN THE DATA.\n\"\"\")\n\n# Calculate and display some additional statistics\nprint(\"ADDITIONAL STATISTICS:\")\nprint(f\"Mean of target values: {np.mean(y):.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Standard deviation of target values: {np.std(y):.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Prediction range: [{min(y_pred):.3f}, {max(y_pred):.3f}]\")\nprint(f\"Actual range: [{min(y_test):.3f}, {max(y_test):.3f}]\")\n\n# Show how much variance is explained\nvariance_explained = r2 * 100\nprint(f\"\\nVariance Explained: {variance_explained:.1f}%\")\n\nprint(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50)\nprint(\"CONCLUSION\")\nprint(\"=\"*50)\nprint(\"\"\"\nThis XGBoost regression model demonstrates exceptional performance \non the synthetic dataset. The high R² score and low error metrics \nindicate that:\n1. The features contain strong predictive signals\n2. The model architecture is well-suited for this type of data\n3. Feature_2 is the dominant predictor in determining target values\n\nSuch a model would be valuable in real-world applications where \nhigh prediction accuracy is required, such as financial forecasting,\nmedical diagnosis, or any domain requiring reliable numerical predictions.\n\"\"\")\n```",
