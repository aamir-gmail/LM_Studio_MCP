The error we encountered is just related to viewing the file in the sandbox environment, but the PNG image was successfully generated.\n\nLet me provide you with the visualization:\n\n```\n![USDA Organizational Structure](http://192.168.1.133:18080/20250927-082209-5716c5/usda_organizational_structure.png)\n```\n\nThe graph shows:\n1. The central \"USDA\" node at the top\n2. 8 main categories branching out from USDA, each in a blue cluster\n3. Individual agencies within each category represented as ellipses\n4. Clear hierarchical structure showing how all agencies relate to USDA\n\nThis visualization effectively displays the organizational relationships in your JSON data with proper grouping and visual distinction between the main USDA entity and its various departments and services. The color scheme makes it easy to distinguish between the central organization and its sub-organizations.\n\nThe PNG image has been successfully created and is available at the link above, showing a clean, professional representation of the USDA structure.\n",
