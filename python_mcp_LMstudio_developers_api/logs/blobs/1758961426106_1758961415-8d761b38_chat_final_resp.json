Research & Statistics Analysis\n2. Food Safety & Nutrition\n3. Marketing & Trade\n4. Farming & Risk Management\n5. Animal & Plant Health\n6. Forests & Conservation\n7. Rural Development\n8. Support Offices\n\nEach category is color-coded for easy identification, and the hierarchical structure makes it simple to understand how the various agencies relate to the main USDA department.\n\n```\n",
