The graph now has USDA positioned on the left side with all other nodes arranged to the right, creating a clear hierarchical flow from the central department outward.\n\n**Key improvements made:**\n- Set `rankdir='LR'` for left-to-right layout\n- Positioned \"United States Department of Agriculture\" on the far left\n- All category clusters and their respective agencies are now displayed to the right\n- Maintained all original data integrity and visual distinctions\n\nThe visualization clearly shows how each agency belongs to its respective USDA division while maintaining a clean, professional appearance. The color-coded categories make it easy to distinguish between different functional areas of the department.\n\n```\n[20250927-082506-385a12/usda_organizational_structure.png](http://192.168.1.133:18080/20250927-082506-385a12/usda_organizational_structure.png)\n```",
